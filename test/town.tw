:: Plaza
The glittering [[Palace]] dominates the plaza. A haggard-looking [[signpost|Signpost]] stands in the center of the pavement. Around it is a cluster of buildings, most of them abandoned-looking: you can make out an [[Armory]] and a [[Bank]].

:: Palace
Though its gleaming, windowless walls reveal nothing, you are certain of some kind of presence beyond the Palace's wide - and (if: $palacekey is "yes")[[[locked|Opened gate]]](else:)[(if: $vaultkey is "yes")[[[locked|Wrong key]]](else:)[locked]] - gate.

(display: 'Plaza')


:: Armory
What first catches your eye is the large [[Vault]]. The rest of the building is taken up with stalls, most of them empty. But you can see one [[Vendor]] hunched over a counter, and in another stall, a [[figure|Guardian]] marching back and forth.

The Town [[Plaza]] is through the door behind you.


:: Vendor
(if $metvendor == "no")The old Vendor's eyes light up as she sees a customer approach, probably for the first time in a long while.<html><br></html>
"You must be new to town!" she croaks. "If you want to be successful, you'll need to buy supplies."<html><br></html>
From behind the counter she produces a crate of [[ammunition|Too poor]] and a bundle of [[torches|Too poor]]. It also seems as though she's willing to offer [[advice|Advice]].<html><br></html>
Or you could simply [[walk away|Armory]].(set: $metvendor = "yes">><<else>><<display Wares>><<endif)


:: Wares
The vendor sits between a crate of [[ammo|Too poor]] and a bundle of [[torches|Too poor]]. (if $advised == "no">>She also seems to have some [[advice|Advice]] she's eager to give.<<endif)

(if $noticedcrest == "no">>You notice, for the first time, the [[crest|Crest]] on the wall beside the stall.<<set $noticedcrest = "yes">><<else>>An ornate [[crest|Crest]] decorates the wall beside the vendor's stall.<<endif)

The rest of the Armory is [[behind you|Armory]].


:: Advice
She leans in close, her eyes twinkling and her voice falling to a conspiratorial whisper as she recites her rhyme.

"It is whispered that soon if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forests will echo with laughter."(set: $advised to "yes")

(display: 'Wares')


:: Too poor
(if $explainedgems == "no">>You pull some crumpled bills from your pocket, but it becomes clear that currency in this town is nothing as flimsy as paper: she expects gemstones, and you have none.<<set $explainedgems = "yes")

(else>>"You can't afford it!"<<endif)

(display: 'Wares')


:: Crest
(if $foundpassword == "no")A metal crest of a shield with crossed swords. There are a few of them hanging from the Armory's walls, now that you notice. But this one is different: there's an empty space between it and the wall. It's on [[hinges|Password]].
<html><br></html>Behind you, the [[vendor|Vendor]] is checking her inventory.(else)Behind the crest: "40364, bank on it."
<html><br></html>Behind you, the [[Armory]].(endif)


:: Password
You lift the hinges to discover numbers scratched into the wall behind the crest:

40364.(set: $foundpassword to "yes")

A message scrawled beneath says "bank on it!"

The rest of the [[Armory]] pays your discovery no mind.


:: Guardian
(if $keyfell == "no">>An armor-clad man marches back and forth beside a pedestal, atop which sits a plain-looking key. The counter stands between yourself and the key and its guardian, but a [[bell|Bell]] sits on the counter, waiting to be rung.<<else>>An armor-clad man marches back and forth beside an empty pedestal.<<if $vaultkey == "no">><html>&nbsp;</html>The [[key|Key]] he was guarding now lies on the floor.<<endif>> A [[bell|Bell]] rests on the counter.<<endif)

The [[Armory]] is to your rear.


:: Bell
(if $keyfell == "no">>The guard turns toward the sound of the bell, invariably knocking the key from its pedestal as he does so.<<set $keyfell = "yes")
<html><br></html>"Go away, cretin!" he snips.
<html><br></html>He returns to his marching, unaware that the [[key|Key]] has fallen from its perch.(else>>"Go away, cretin!" snips the guardian of the key.<<if $vaultkey == "no")<html><br></html>
But the [[key|Key]] is sitting on the floor.(else>><html>&nbsp;</html>But the key is gone.<<endif>><<endif)

The [[Armory]] is to your rear.


:: Key
The guard continuing his marching, you pick up the key and tuck it in your pocket, unseen by the eyes of the [[Armory]].(set: $vaultkey to "yes")


:: Vault
(if $torch == "no">><<if $vaultkey == "no">>A massive vault with a tiny keyhole takes up half the [[Armory]].<<else>>A massive vault with a tiny [[keyhole|Inside vault]] takes up half the [[Armory]].<<endif)
<html><br></html>You can see a [[figure|Guardian]] pacing nearby.(else>>The vault is open and empty. All that remain of interest in the [[Armory]] are a [[vendor|Vendor]] and the [[exit|Plaza]].<<endif)


:: Signpost
Most of the words on the sign have long faded, but you can make out fragments:

"Welcome to the Town of...find the...unlock...the Palace, your destination."

(display: 'Plaza')


:: Bank
(if $torch == "no")The Bank's interior is pitch dark: you'll have to save exploration for later.
<html><br></html>(display: 'Plaza>><<else>><<if $littorch == "no">>You light your torch as you enter the Bank.<<set $littorch = "yes"')
<html><br></html>(endif)The Bank is long abandoned: dusty floors and empty teller's desks. But in the flickering torchlight, you can make out a single closed [[safe|Safe]] behind a desk.
<html><br></html>A patch of daylight spills in from the [[exit|Plaza]] but doesn't get very far.(endif)


:: Inside vault
This vault was emptied long ago. All that's left among the dust and cobwebs is a single [[torch|Torch]].


:: Torch
You take the torch and abandon the empty vault. The lone [[vendor|Vendor]] and the [[exit|Plaza]] beckon from opposite corners of the [[Armory]].(set: $torch to "yes")


:: Safe
(if $palacekey == "no">><<if $foundpassword == "no")The safe has a combination lock, and you don't have the combination. You exit the Bank.
<html><br></html>(display: 'Plaza>><<else')The safe has a [[combination lock|Purple key]].
<html><br></html>The light of the [[exit|Plaza]] is at your back.(endif>><<else)The safe lies open and empty, as does the Bank. You take your leave.
<html><br></html>(display: 'Plaza>><<endif')


:: Purple key
You dial the numbers from the Armory: 40364.

There's a click, and sure enough, the safe swings open to reveal a key glittering with inlaid jewels of white and purple. The key is heavy when you lift it, and almost doesn't fit in your pocket.(set: $palacekey to "yes")

The [[exit|Plaza]] of the Bank stands open.


:: Wrong key
The plain key you found in the Armoury is not quite up to the task of opening this wide, glittering gate. You'll need something more appropriate.

(display: 'Plaza')


:: Opened gate
As you turn the key in the glittering gate and push it open, you notice that a humming you weren't aware of until now has stopped, as if holding its breath. The dark interior of the [[Palace|Throne room]] beckons.


:: Throne room
A carpet of colors unfolds beneath your feet towards a shining throne at the center of the palace. Overhead, dazzling lights coalesce into the words:

''YOU WIN''

# Grunt Example

You way wish to use grunt to give you a wider variety of build/compile/watch options. The following shows a basic grunt setup where all folders are watched for changes to files, twee2 builds the main `story.html` file automatically on every change, and it is live-reloaded in your browser.

## SETUP

`bundle install`  

`npm install`

`grunt watch`

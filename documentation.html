          <h2 id='relationship-to-twine'>Relationship to Twine</h2>
          <p>
            Twee2 is built on top of
            <a href='http://twinery.org/'>Twine 2</a>,
            minus the graphical user interface. As a result, virtually all of the
            <a href='http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide'>documentation about Twine 2</a>
            (and specifically the documentation about the
            <a href='http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_choose_a_story_format'>different story formats</a>)
            is relevant to Twee2, too.
            Because Twee2 is inspired by Twee, its documentation is also a valuable resource: however note that
            you can't use Twee 'macros' in Twee2.
          </p>
          <h2 id='writing-code'>Writing and compiling code</h2>
          <p>
            Write Twee2 code using your favourite text editor. Syntax highlighting is available via
            <a href='https://github.com/monospaced/sublime-twee'>this Sublime Text plugin</a>
            for Twee. By convention, Twee2 source files have the
            <code>.tw2</code>
            extension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compile Twee2 files using the
            <code>twee2</code>
            command-line tool. There are two important modes of operation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>twee2 build input.tw2 output.html</code>
              produces output.html based on the code in input.tw2
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>twee2 watch input.tw2 output.html</code>
              does the same thing, but
              <em>watches</em>
              input.tw2 for changes, automatically recompiling whenever it is updated (note that it's not
              smart enough to understand when
              <a href='#includes'>'included'</a>
              files have been changed, though).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because Twee2 source files are just plain text files, they're well-suited to use with
            source control systems: you could, for example, use
            <a href='https://github.com/'>Github</a>
            to share your code or to collaborate with other authors, even working on the same file.
          </p>
          <h2 id='story-formats'>Understanding story formats</h2>
          <p>
            Twee2 comes with built-in support for all of the same story formats that Twine 2 does:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href='http://twine2.neocities.org/'>Harlowe</a>
              - the default format, which includes a simplified scripting format
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href='https://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2'>Snowman</a>
              - a minimal format that uses Underscore.js templates and jQuery to provide programmers with a powerful toolset
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href='http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/'>SugarCube</a>
              - a TiddlyWiki-powered format that comes with support for multiple save 'slots' and a Twine 1/Twee 'macro'-like scripting syntax
            </li>
            <li>
              Paperthin - used when you select "View Proofing Copy" in Twine 2, this minimal skeleton isn't really an output format as it is a proofing tool
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you've having difficulty choosing between them, there's
            <a href='http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_choose_a_story_format'>a summary of the differences</a>
            in the Twine 2 documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To specify which format to use during compilation, use the optional
            <code>--format</code>
            parameter. E.g. you might type
            <code>twee2 build input.tw2 output.html --format=Snowman</code>.
            You can get a list of the formats that Twee2 natively understands by running
            <code>twee2 formats</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible to use any story format, e.g. if you've downloaded or written your own, by specifying the path
            to the story format's directory (the one containing the format.js file) in your
            <code>--format</code>
            parameter. For example, you might run
            <code>twee2 build input.tw2 output.html --format=./MyFormat</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than setting the format on the command-line, it's possible to specify it within your source code
            itself, using
            <a href='#build-config'>build configuration</a>
            options.
          </p>
          <h2 id='twee2-syntax'>Twee2 syntax</h2>
          <p>
            Twee2 uses a syntax that's heavily inspired-by but not 100% compatible with Twee:
          </p>
          <h3 id='twee2-syntax-passages'>Passages</h3>
          <p>
            Each block of text in Twee2 exists in a
            <em>passage</em>.
            Each passage begins with a title, which is prefixed by two colons:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>::My Passage Name</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Passage titles may only contain letters, numbers, basic punctuation, and spaces. Some authors prefer to avoid
            spaces in their passage titles. Passage titles are not case-sensitive: you don't have to use the same case when
            referring to a passage every time. Passages titles
            <em>should</em>
            be unique within a story: if they're not, only the last passage with a given title will be included in the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passage titles may optionally be suffixed by one or both of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any number of
              <em>tags</em>,
              separated by spaced, inside a pair of square brackets. E.g:
              <br>
              <code>::My Passage Name [tagone tagtwo]</code>
              <br>
              Tags can be used by code in your story (e.g. to send the player to a randomly-selected passage from a subset).
              <a href='#twee2-syntax-special-passages'>Some tags have special meanings</a>,
              as described below.
            </li>
            <li>
              A pair of coordinates, separated by a comma and enclosed within angle brackets. E.g.:
              <br>
              <code>::My Passage Name <123,456></code>
              <br>
              Coordinates have no meaning to Twee2, but they can be used to enhance compatability with Twine 2: Twine 2 uses
              these coordinates to decide where to show the passages in its WYSIWYG editor.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you include both tags and coordinates after a passage, the tags must come before the coordinates, e.g.:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>::My Passage Name [tagone tagtwo] <123,456></code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some passages and tags
            <a href='#twee2-syntax-special-passages'>have special meanings</a>,
            as described below
          </p>
          <h3 id='twee2-syntax-content'>Content</h3>
          <p>
            Each passage may contain any amount of content, most of which will be stuff that the player sees. Many
            story formats understand
            <em>Markdown</em>
            formatting in passages, which makes it possible to easily add formatting to your passages. Links to different
            passages are supported in any of the following syntaxes (where 'Dungeon' is the name of the passage they'll be
            transported if they click the link, and 'click here', where present, is the text that they'll see to click on):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>[Dungeon]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>[click here->Dungeon]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>[Dungeon<-click here]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>[click here|Dungeon]</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id='twee2-syntax-special-passages'>Special passages</h2>
          <p>
            Some passage names and tags have special meanings. These are:
          </p>
          <h3>::Start</h3>
          <p>
            The
            <code>::Start</code>
            passage will, by default, be used as the initial passage that your player sees when they start reading.
            You can override this using
            <a href='#build-config'>build configuration options</a>,
            but it's probably easier just to follow this convention.
          </p>
          <h3>::StorySubtitle, ::StoryAuthor, ::StoryMenu, and ::StorySettings</h3>
          <p>
            These names were used for special passages in Twee 1. They're not used by Twee2, but to maintain compatability
            with Twee 1 they're ignored and you should avoid using them unless you're writing a story that needs to be
            capable of being compiled by both Twee 1 and Twee2.
          </p>
          <h3>::StoryIncludes</h3>
          <p>
            Any
            <code>::StoryIncludes</code>
            passages (you can have as many as you like, but you probably should avoid having more than one in any file in
            order to avoid confusion) are treated as lists of secondary Twee2 files to 'include' into your story. This is
            described in more detail below, under
            <a href='#includes'>splitting your code into multiple files</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>[stylesheet]</h3>
          <p>
            Any passages with the 'stylesheet' tag will not be included in your story, but their contents will be injected
            into the story's stylesheet. For example, you could write:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>::MyCoolStylesheet [stylesheet]&#x000A;&#x000A;body {&#x000A;  background: #eee;&#x000A;}&#x000A;&#x000A;tw-passage tw-link {&#x000A;  color: red;&#x000A;}</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also possible to use
            <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>SASS</a>
            to enhance your stylesheet. Simply add the tag 'sass' or 'scss' to specify the dialect of SASS that you want
            to use, e.g.:
            <pre>::MyCoolStylesheet [scss stylesheet]&#x000A;&#x000A;body {&#x000A;  background: #eee;&#x000A;}&#x000A;&#x000A;tw-passage {&#x000A;  tw-link {&#x000A;    color: red;&#x000A;  }&#x000A;}&#x000A;</pre>
          </p>
          <h3>[script]</h3>
          <p>
            Any passages with the 'script' tag will not be included in your story, but their contents will be injected
            into the resulting web page as Javascript. For example, you could write:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>::SomeAwesomeCode [script]&#x000A;&#x000A;alert('This message will appear when the adventure starts!');</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also possible to use
            <a href='http://coffeescript.org/'>Coffeescript</a>
            to make your Javascript development more-beautiful. Simply add the tag 'coffee' to your script block:
            <pre>::SomeAwesomeCode [coffee script]&#x000A;&#x000A;alert 'This message will appear when the adventure starts!'&#x000A;</pre>
          </p>
          <h3>[haml]</h3>
          <p>
            Put the 'haml' tag into your regular passages in order to allow you to write
            <a href='http://haml.info/'>HAML</a>
            code into your passages. HAML is a sophisticated templating language for producing HTML output, and
            for some it might be preferable to writing plain old Markdown. This includes the ability to inject
            Javascript/CoffeeScript into particular passages. For example, you could write:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>::NicksBar [haml]&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  Nick's Bar is exactly the kind of nightspot that helps you remember why you quit drinking.&#x000A;  A depressed-looking barman pours another beer for an equally depressed-looking drunk, while&#x000A;  over in the corner a street thug plays with a knife as he eyes you up. The floor is sticky&#x000A;  and the air reeks of stale alcohol.&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  %strong What would you like to do?&#x000A;%ul&#x000A;  %li [Nick<-Talk to the bartender]&#x000A;  %li [BarToilet<-Go to the bathroom]&#x000A;  %li [BarSit<-Sit in a booth]&#x000A;&#x000A;:coffeescript&#x000A;  $ ->&#x000A;    alert "This message will appear when you reach Nick's Bar!"&#x000A;</pre>
          </p>
          <h3>[twee2]</h3>
          <p>
            Passages marked with the 'twee2' tag are not included in your story. However, any Ruby code in them
            will be executed when the passage is processed by the builder. This can be used to
            <a href='#build-config'>set build configuration options</a>
            as described below.
          </p>
          <h2 id='includes'>Splitting your code into multiple files</h2>
          <p>
            A major benefit of Twee2 over Twine 2 is that it's possible to break apart your story into multiple
            files, which can be used to structure your work, to facilitate teamworking with or without source
            control, and to make 'reusable' components such as stylesheets and scripts which can then be injected
            into later stories. There are two ways to do this:
          </p>
          <h3>Using ::StoryIncludes</h3>
          <p>
            Insert a
            <code>::StoryIncludes</code>
            passage into your file and list within it the names of the files to include. Each will be appended
            to the end of your story before compilation. For example, the following game skeleton includes the
            contents of four other files - the main file contains only the
            <code>::Start</code>
            passage:
          </p>
          <p>

          <h3>Using ::@include directives</h3>
          <p>
            You can put an
            <code>::@include</code>
            directive anywhere in your code to insert the contents of another file at that point.
            <code>::@include</code>
            respects your current indentation level (e.g. when using HAML), so it's safe to use at any indentation
            'depth'. For example, the following passages each include a separate file that contains a description
            of the house in the distance: that description is shared between the two passages, and updating the
            file updates the description in both.
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>::Greenhouse [haml]&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  Light shines brightly through the tall glass walls of the ornate wrought-iron greenhouse, and&#x000A;  the plants are verdant and lively. The [Garden<-door] stands open and a cool breeze blows in.&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  ::@include description-of-house.tw2&#x000A;&#x000A;::Garden [haml]&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  The garden winds around decorative trees betwen the [greenhouse] and the [Porch<-mansion].&#x000A;%p&#x000A;  ::@include description-of-house.tw2&#x000A;</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that neither method of including code works recursively (i.e. you can't include a file that in
            turn includes another file), but this may be fixed in a future version.

          <h2 id='build-config'>Setting build configuration options</h2>
          <p>
            Creating a passage with the 'twee2' tag can be used to run arbritrary Ruby code or to pass additional
            options to the Twee2 compiler. This expands the potential capability of Twee2 almost-limitlessly, but for now
            the only supported options are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                <code>Twee2::build_config.story_ifid = '<em>[your IFID]</em>'</code>
              </strong>
              - used to set the
              <a href='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/IFID'>IFID of your story, to facilitate catologuing. If you</a>
              don't include this directive, the compiler will suggest a random one to you every time you run it and
              explain how to add it: if you're going to publish your story publicly, you should add the line it
              suggests before you do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                <code>Twee2::build_config.story_format = '<em>[a story format]</em>'</code>
              </strong>
              - an alternative way of specifying the story format used by your story, rather than using the --format
              switch to the compiler. The syntax of format names and means of specifying externally-stored formats is
              identical to
              <a href='#story-formats'>using the --format switch</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>::Configuration [twee2]&#x000A;Twee2::build_config.story_ifid = '41AB7776-D198-40F5-BD54-0493D49DA58C'&#x000A;Twee2::build_config.story_format = 'Snowman'&#x000A;</pre>
          </p>
          <h2 id='decompiler'>Decompiling Twine 2 stories</h2>
          <p>
            It's possible to convert existing (compiled) Twee2/Twine 2 story files, in HTML format, back into
            Twee2 source files for further editing. This can be used to convert your Twine 2 projects into Twee2
            files or to easily examine the contents of somebody else's story. This feature does not work on Microsoft
            Windows. To use it, run:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>twee2 decompile input.html output.tw2</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The input HTML file can optionally be a full web URL.
